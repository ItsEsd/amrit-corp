        Eliza's main purpose was to demonstrate the superficiality of
        communication between humans and machines. Despite its simplicity, Eliza
        often managed to elicit responses from users that suggested they were
        engaging with a real human therapist. It played a significant role in
        the development of natural language processing and artificial
        intelligence, influencing subsequent chatbot designs and research in
        human-computer interaction. This early natural language processing
        program had been written in the mid-1960s at the MIT Artificial
        Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum.
        <p>
          WHAT DOES ELIZA DO?<br />
          Using &quot;'pattern matching" and substitution methodology, the
          program gives canned responses that made early users feel they were
          talking to someone who understood their input. The program was limited
          by the scripts that were in the program. (ELIZA was originally written
          in
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAD_(programming_language)"
            title="about"
            target="_blank"
            >MAD-Slip</a
          >.) Many variations on the original scripts were made as amateur
          coders played around with the fairly simple code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the most well known variation was called DOCTOR. This was made
          to respond like a<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-centered_therapy"
            title="about"
            target="_blank"
          >
            Rogerian psychotherapist.</a
          >
          In this instance, the therapist "reflects" on questions by turning the
          questions back at the patient.
        </p>
        <p>
          ELIZA was one of the first chatterbots (later clipped to chatbot). It
          was also an early test case for the Turing Test, a test of a machine's
          ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or
          indistinguishable from, that of a human. By today's standards ELIZA
          fails very quickly if you ask it a few complex questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Give ELIZA a try. You can sit on your own couch and pretend it is a
          therapist's couch. And, as with Siri, Alexa and other operating system
          disembodied voices, feel free to conjure up your own idea of what
          ELIZA looks like.
